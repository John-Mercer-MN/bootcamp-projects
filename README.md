## Offensive Security
**MegaCorpOne Penetration Test Report - John Mercer.docx**

This was an Offensive Security Penetration testing on the servers of the fictious company Megacorpone.
It was a multi-day excercise where we addressed the website, Linux servers, and Windows servers for the company.
The file is the final report of that activity, describing the vulnerabilities found.

## Project 2
**Rekall Penetration Test Report - John Mercer.docx**

This was a Capture the Flag event on the servers of the fictious company Rekall.
It was a three-day event where we addressed the website, Linux servers, and Windows servers for the company.
The file is the final report of that activity, describing the flags found and the vulnerabilities exploited to find them.

## Digital Forensics
**Digital Forensics report - John Mercer.docx**

This excercise was to examine a captured image of an iPhone to examine the messages, emails, photos, 
and location data using Autopsy to determine who was involved in an fictious incident at the National Gallery.
The file is the final report of that activity, describing the data found.

## Project 3
**Defensive Security project report - John Mercer.pptx**

This was a group project where we used logs from an Apache web server and a Windows server to set up alerts, 
reports, and dashboards in Splunk.  We then used additional logs captured during an attack to determine if our
alerts, reports, and dashboards would detect the attacks.  The file is the presentation our group gave to describe 
how well our configuration detected the activity.

## Project 4
**BootCon Presentation - John Mercer.pptx**

This was an individual project to perform some activity or research an present it to the rest of the class
in the form of a conference presentation.  I chose to setup a wireless network for testing and then cracked 
the WEP key using Wireshark and aircrack-ng.  The file is the presentation I gave to the class.  
There was also a live demonstation, which is shown as screen shots in this presentation.
